## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Basically : - Looking at the datasets
            - Finding Clues
            - Looking for abnormalities
            - Cleaning it
            - Shapping it
            - Visualizing it 
            - Constatly reiterating to arrive at your research questions

```{r}
# First look at your dataset
head(diamonds)
head(mpg)
```



```{r}
## Read this again: 
#  The variable smaller recieves the value of the output of diamonds... 
#  being filtered when carat <3
#  So => the allocation happens only when carat is less than 3

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
    filter(carat < 3)

##
ggplot(data=smaller, mapping = aes(x=carat))+
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)

##
ggplot(data = mpg)+
    geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x=reorder(class,hwy,FUN = median),y=hwy))

##
diamonds%>%
    count(color,cut)%>%
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x=color,y=cut))+
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill=n))


```
